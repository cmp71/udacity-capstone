# udacity-capstone
Udacity Cloud and DevOps Engineer Nano Degree - Capstone project

## Rubric checklist
### Create Github repository with project code. All project code is stored in a GitHub repository and a link to the repository has been provided for reviewers.
This repo.
### Use image repository to store Docker images. The project uses a centralized image repository to manage images built in the project. After a clean build, images are pushed to the repository.
https://hub.docker.com/r/agilealchemy/capstone-nginx/tags
### Execute linting step in code pipeline. Code is checked against a linter as part of a Continuous Integration step (demonstrated w/ two screenshots)

### Build a Docker container in a pipeline. The project takes a Dockerfile and creates a Docker container in the pipeline.
This project uses a simple nginx docker image. The `Dockerfile` is in the root of this repo. This Dockerfile is used to create a new image with the following section of the Jenkinsfile. The new docker image is tagged with the current Jenkins build number:
```groovy
    stage('Build Docker image') {
      steps {
        sh "docker build --tag=capstone-nginx:${BUILD_NUMBER} ."
      }
    }
```
It is then uploaded to Docker Hub with the following section of the Jenkinsfile:
```groovy
    stage('Push Docker image') {
      steps {
        withDockerRegistry([url: "", credentialsId: "dockerhub"]) {
          sh "docker image tag capstone-nginx:${BUILD_NUMBER} agilealchemy/capstone-nginx"
          sh "docker push agilealchemy/capstone-nginx"
        }  
      }
    }
```

### The Docker container is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster is deployed with CloudFormation or Ansible. This should be in the source code of the studentâ€™s submission.
Kubernetes cluster was deployed to AWS from the CLI using EKSCTL. The command to do so is within [createEKScluster.sh](https://github.com/cmp71/udacity-capstone/blob/master/createEKScluster.sh)

Output of the cluster build script -

### Use Blue/Green Deployment or a Rolling Deployment successfully. The project performs the correct steps to do a blue/green or a rolling deployment into the environment selected. Student demonstrates the successful completion of chosen deployment methodology with screenshots.
Strategy chosen is Rolling Deployment.

This is achieved via setting `strategy.type` to `RollingUpdate` in [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/cmp71/udacity-capstone/blob/master/deployment.yaml) which is used as in input file to `kubectl apply`.

The rolling update is initiated by running the command `kubectl rollout restart deployment capstone` as part of the pipeline.
